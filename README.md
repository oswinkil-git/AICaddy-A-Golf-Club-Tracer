# AICaddy-A-Golf-Club-Tracer
AICaddy is a Python program and Yolov8 model that aims to allow anyone to use machine learning to trace their golf swing for better analysis. The model is already trained on 6000+ images of golf club heads (just drivers). The tracing is hardware intensive, so if you can, please use a powerful server with the program.

For reference, A VPS with 30 vCPU cores, 200GB of RAM, 1.4TB of SSD storage, and an A10 GPU takes 2.6 minutes to trace a 31-second video
